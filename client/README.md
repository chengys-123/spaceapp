This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1) Two command prompts required to run server and client respectively. (Concurrent run is not configured).
2) On spaceapp directory, run the command: "npm run start" to start the server. You can browse to localhost:4000/graphiql for API query.
3) On client directory, run the command: "npm run dev" to start the client. You can then browse to localhost:3000 to access the website.
4) P.S. Thanks for the opportunity given.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
